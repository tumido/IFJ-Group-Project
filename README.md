Message to future generations
-----------------------------
Our project was not as successful as we hoped. For the next time (and for you, who are reading this) reserve yourself more of your time for IFJ project, and carefully pick your team members (pick someone who is capable of solid work and is focused on the project as you are)

If you want to use this project for your inspiration feel free to do so, but you have been warned. This is __not__ the best example of working project, it has more mistakes that you can count.
